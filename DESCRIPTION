Description: Calculating users of a product based on the prevalence of triers in the population. The measuring of triers is relatively easy. It is just a question of whether a person tried a product even once in his life or not. While measuring the rate of people who also adopt it as part of their life is more complicated since the adoption of an innovative product is a subjective view of the individual. Mickey Kislev and Shira Kislev developed a formula to calculates the prevalence of users of a product to overcome this difficulty. The current calculator assists in calculating the users of a product based on the prevalence of triers in the population. See for: Kislev, M., and S. Kislev (2020) <doi:10.5539/ijms.v12n4p63>.
